Here's a quick guide to get you started:

#### üê¶ **Get Your Twitter API Keys!** üóùÔ∏è

1. **Join the Twitter Developer Platform:**  Navigate to the [Twitter Developer Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal) and sign in or sign up if you haven't already. This platform provides the tools and resources necessary to create and manage your Twitter apps.

2. **Create Your App:** Once logged in, navigate to "Projects & Apps" and select "Create App". You'll be prompted to name your project, describe its purpose, and define its intended use. This step generates the necessary credentials, including Consumer Keys and Access Tokens, which serve as your gateway to Twitter's API. Remember to adjust your User authentication settings before accessing them.

    - **Authorization Permissions:** Choose both read and write access permissions. This ensures that your application can retrieve and modify data as required.

    - **Application Type:** Specify the type of your application as either Web App, Automated App, or Bot. This classification helps the platform understand the nature of your application's interactions.

    - **Additional Information:** In the application information section, include a callback URL and website URL, even if they don't directly impact the bot's functionality. These URLs are necessary for user authentication purposes. Simply add any valid URL to fulfill this requirement.

3. **Access Your Keys and Tokens:** After creating your app, locate the "Keys and tokens" section within your project dashboard. Here, you'll find your Consumer Keys and Access Tokens, which are essential for authenticating your application's access to Twitter's API services. Store them somewhere safe as they will be needed in future.

If you're still unsure about how to access the API key, check out this video [here](https://youtu.be/rIyRrUAsaok?si=g7qg2Anhv9SEm9xK).

#### <u>Integrate Your Bot into the Digital World:</u>:

1. **Add Your Bot to a Group or Channel:** To integrate your bot into a Telegram group or channel, simply search for its username within Telegram and click "Add" to include it in the desired group/channel.
